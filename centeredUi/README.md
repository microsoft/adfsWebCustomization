# Match Azure AD Centered Login Page 

## Overview

This project provides an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) style sheet to allow your AD FS login form to be consistent with the [new Azure Active Directory centered sign-in experience](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/08/02/the-new-azure-ad-signin-experience-is-now-in-public-preview/).

Note that this customization comes in two parts. The first is a style sheet, which allows the look-and-feel of your AD FS to match the Azure AD centered UI experience. The second is a more advanced customization, using the AD FS JavaScript customization feature to create a front-end paginated sign-in experience.

## Getting Started

We will break the deployment of this feature into two parts. First, the style sheet to create a consistent look-and-feel. Second, the JavaScript to create a front-end paginated experience. You can choose if you wish to deploy one or both.

## Getting Started - Style Sheet Deployment

1. Download the ```ThemeCenterBrand.css``` file to your AD FS server, wherever you host your style sheets.

    Note: It is recommended that you minify your CSS for a production environment.

2. Create a custom web theme using the following command in PowerShell:

    ```New-AdfsWebTheme –Name custom -SourceName default –StyleSheet @{path="c:\style\ThemeCenterBrand.css"}```

3. Apply the new custom web theme using the following command in PowerShell:

    ```Set-AdfsWebConfig -ActiveThemeName custom```

4. Update the logo and background image. For details and image size recommendations, see [this post](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/azure-ux-web-theme-in-ad-fs).

## Getting Started - JavaScript Deployment

1. Download the ```paginatedOnload.js``` file to your AD FS server, wherever you host your JavaScript.

    Note: It is *__highly__* recommended that you minify your ```paginatedOnload.js``` before including it in a production environment. There are many popular tools online for minifying JavaScript code. Two popular choices are [minifier.org](http://www.minifier.org/) and [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/).

2. Modify your existing custom web theme from the style sheet deployment to include the new JavaScript. In PowerShell:

    ```Set-AdfsWebTheme –TargetName custom -AdditionalFileResource @{Uri="/adfs/portal/script/onload.js"; path="c:\paginatedOnload.js"}```

3. Apply the modified custom web theme using the following command in PowerShell:

    ```Set-AfsWebConfig -ActiveThemeName custom```

4. For more information on JavaScript customization, see [Advanced AD FS Customization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/advanced-customization-of-ad-fs-sign-in-pages).

## Additional JavaScript Changes

The JavaScript we provide out-of-the-box does not provide two key features you may want.

1. The JavaScript works for deployments in most major languages. However, if you wish to have your pages work under other languages, you will need to follow the steps below in ```Supporting Non-English Languages```.

2. The new paginated sign in contains a user avatar image. By default, this image is a standard empty user avatar (shown below). To support user avatar lookup, you will need to follow the steps below in ```Supporting User Avatar Lookup```.

## Supporting Non-English Languages

In order to support non-English languages, you will need to add translated text for the new UI items that are created by the JavaScript.

In the code, you should locate the translation table in the function ```GetLocalizedStringForElement```. You should add translations for the text in the translation table.

Each translation should be mapped to the correct language code. For a reference on language codes, see the ```ISO 639-1 Code``` column in the table at [this resource](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).

## Supporting User Avatar Lookup

The Azure AD experience includes a user avatar on the password page, on the right side of the banner. AD FS does not have support for the concept of a user avatar, so it's not possible to include this logic out-of-the-box. If you wish to support this behavior, you will have to build a web API that accepts a username, and returns an image. You will then have to update the ```paginatedOnload.js``` code to make the request for the user avatar image, and handle the response.

If you are interested in working with the AD FS Open Source community to build a user avatar web app, please contact mattbo@microsoft.com.
