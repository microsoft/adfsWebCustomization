Client Interactive Completion Percentage (Total for 1 week): 

For all requests that come to ADFS, what percentage of those requests end up returning or erroring out? (i.e. (#succeeded + #failed) / (#started))

Important filters: 

    • We remove all traffic from known web crawlers, as marked by the App Insights library (using Synthetic Source) 
    • We remove all traffic for which there is no correlation ID set 
    • We remove all traffic that appears abnormal, meaning traffic for which there is a high page refresh or page navigation rate 

Important Caveats: 

    • Because we cannot guarantee what the end state of the request is, the numbers here are based on the likely outcome of the request
